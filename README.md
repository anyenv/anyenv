# anyenv - all in one for \*\*env

## INSTALL

    $ git clone https://github.com/riywo/anyenv ~/.anyenv
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.anyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.your_profile
    $ echo 'eval "$(anyenv init -)"' >> ~/.your_profile
    $ exec $SHELL -l

    $ anyenv install rbenv
    $ anyenv install plenv
    $ anyenv install pyenv
    $ anyenv install phpenv
    $ anyenv install ndenv

    $ exec $SEHLL -l
    $ rbenv install 2.0.0-p195
